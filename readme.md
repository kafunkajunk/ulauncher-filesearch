# Summary

This project is a python plugin for [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/).

It provides similar file searching functionality to Alfred and Spotlight by utilizing `updatedb` and `mlocate`.

If a result is found, the plugin then prompts for actions such as:

   - opening the file.
   - copying the full path to the clipboard.

Potentially, any action exposed through the plugin api could be added. 

# Dependencies

This plugin needs a path to a db file which contains any relevant indexed files on the system.
